# MLOPS Course

With the strong development of Cloud Computing, the explosion of Big Data and the non-stop development of science and technology,Machine Learning has and widely used in many different industries. The problem that arises is how to increase the performance, reliability of ML applications and reduce the go-to-market time of the build process. and AI/ML applications.

Since then, a series of standards on how to operate and implement ML projects have gradually been formed, opening a whole new direction for Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists, which is Machine Learning Operations or MLOps. With the desire to speed up the process of bringing ML products to reality (production) faster and more efficiently, MLOpsVN has launched the MLOps Crash Course.
